This is my implementation of the last step of the project [Seam Carving](https://hyperskill.org/projects/100?track=3) from the Hyperskill platform.

You can find some DP here which is used to compress images with minimal loss.

To run it, add additional arguments like names of input and output files and how many rows and columns you want to remove,
like "-in img.png -out res.ong -width 20 -height 30",
it will produce an image which is 20px lesser in width and 30px in height.
